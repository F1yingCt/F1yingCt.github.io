This is where I blogging some of my ideas, my research and other interests.

This blog theme is forked from [tmaize-blog](https://github.com/TMaize/tmaize-blog), please star if u like it :D

## My research

I am a postgraduate student of HUST(Huazhong University of Science and Technology) majoring Digital Construction(This is a new subject branching from Civil Engineering). I am working with my advisor Weiya CHEN--who has a background of conputer science--on VR applications in design and training. So I am a semi-CS and semi-EM student :D.

I have developed two VR projects in Unreal Engine 4&5--a skeleton sliding simulator and a building reviewer. You can find them in my posts.

## Other interests

I formed a band with my friends. I am a bassist.
I am a TCG player. 
I also have interests on designing board games.
