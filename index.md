## My research

I am a postgraduate student of HUST (Huazhong University of Science and Technology) majoring  in Digital Construction (This is a new subject deriving from Civil Engineering). I am working with my advisor Weiya CHEN--who has a background of computer science--on Virtual Reality applications in design and training. So I am a semi-CS and semi-EM student.

My research interests are related to VR interaction. I have developed two VR projects in Unreal Engine 4&5--a skeleton sliding simulator and a building reviewer. You can find them in my [posts](https://f1yingct.github.io/pages/posts.html).

## Other interests

- I formed a band with my friends. I am a bassist. See [Music](https://f1yingct.github.io/pages/music.html) for more.
- I also have interests on designing board games.
