> Hello, Welcome to Chris WANG's Page!

This is where I posting some of  my research, my ideas and other interests.

## My research

I am a postgraduate student of HUST(Huazhong University of Science and Technology) majoring  in Digital Construction(This is a new subject branching from Civil Engineering). I am working with my advisor Weiya CHEN--who has a background of conputer science--on Virtual Reality applications in design and training. So I am a semi-CS and semi-EM student.

My research interest is related to VR interaction. I have developed two VR projects in Unreal Engine 4&5--a skeleton sliding simulator and a building reviewer. You can find them in my [posts](https://f1yingct.github.io/pages/posts.html).

## Other interests

- I formed a band with my friends. I am a bassist.
- I also have interests on designing board games.
