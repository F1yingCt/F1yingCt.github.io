> **In the project, we developed a building architectural reviewer. The experiment aimed to explore the most suitable navigation feature for our reviewer.**

There have been three moving technologies available in the reviewer: Joystick, Teleportation, and Leaning. Joystick (**B**) allows users to control viewpoint using a handheld controller, Teleportation (**A**) enables instant movement to a selected destination, and Leaning (**C**) let users lean their bodies to navigate the virtual environment.

## Materials and Participants

### Environments

Three scenes were employed for the experiment: a bookstore, a villa, and a campus, representing three architectural typesâ€”indoor buildings, stand-alone buildings, and building complexes.

### Participants

The evaluation involved 30 participants (22 males, 8 females) aged between 20 and 30. All participants have a background in civil engineering or architecture.
<br>
## Methods

In the formal experiment, each participant sequentially went through three scenes, but the order in which they enter the scenes was randomized. Participants independently completed tasks in the three scenes by following the path, reaching to the task points, and then using the controller to answer questions. The questions included distance and orientation judgments, and the error rates were calculated for the evaluation.  

### 1) Distance judgments

Factors of perceived distance and traversed distance were employed for the analysis of the influence on distance judgments. Perceived distance is further divided into egocentric distance and allocentric distance. Egocentric distance refers to the distance between an object to the individual (typically a human) position, while allocentric distance refers to the distance between external references or the environment objects.

### 2) Orientation judgments

Participants' sense of direction in the virtual environment was assessed through orientation questions, evaluating their ability to understand their current position and discern the direction.

### Questionnaires of user experience
A set of questionnaires was also used to evaluate the user experience of three navigation features: sickness, usability, and comfort. The questionnaires selectively incorporated items from the SSQ,  SUS, and DAQ, assigning scores to comprehensively assess the differences and advantages of three locomotion methods in terms of subjective experience.
<br>
## Hypotheses
1. The accuracy of distance estimation may not show significant differences among the three groups. But Teleportation tends to perform worse in terms of orientation judgment accuracy.


2. In terms of orientation judgment accuracy, the group using Teleportation tends to perform worse.


3. Compared to Joystick and Leaning, Teleportation offers better user experience.
<br>
## Results
The results confirmed our hypothesis regarding users' perception of distance estimation accuracy. However, in relative position judgment, Teleportation demonstrated superior accuracy, which contradicts our initial hypothesis. Additionally, Teleportation provides a better user experience by reducing discomfort and fatigue, while enhancing usability. 
<br>
## Conclusion
The results show that there were no significant differences among the three navigation features in distance estimation. However, Teleportation performed better in reducing motion sickness and demonstrated significantly higher usability. Thus, Teleportation can be the most suitable navigation feature for the architectural reviewer.
