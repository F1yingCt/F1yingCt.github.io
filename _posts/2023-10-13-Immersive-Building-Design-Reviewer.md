## Immersive Building Design Reviewer

Remote collaboration has drawn more and more attention of practitioners in AEC sectors. Especially in building design review, plenty of conceptions or techniques that derive from BIM(Building Information Modelling) have already meet the requirement of remote collaboration. 

However, there have not been a widely adopted platform for the collaboration of building design review. One of the causes is that even in a BCF(BIM Collaboration Format) platform, the efficiency of communication is limited. For example, cooperators need extra explanations like comments to understand the suggestions of each other. When these explanations become mass, cooperators may be confused and have to take effort to learn how to use the platform.

Virtual Reality provides us with powerful tools to handle these problems. In this project, we aimed to develop a building design reviewer that enables users to review the buildings with BIM in immersive environment, interact intuitively with the objects and leave their comments. 

In the following parts, several functions of our design reviewer will be introduced.

###  Navigation

This is a basic function that the implementation of architectural visualization system requires. 

In our reviewer, three navigation methods are provided for users.

**1. Teleport**
**2. Leaning**
**3. Gamepad**
